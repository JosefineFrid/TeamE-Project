# TeamE-Project

Our workplan is to create graph 3.2 and 3.4. The temperature for every day of the year and the mean temperature of each year. Our "own" graph will be the mean temperature of each month in a year. We have decided to use the weather data from Lund.

The logic behind 3.2 and our own is to run the data and for the dates of the year we are checking we collect. Then we split the data up so that it will be printed out in order starting with january 1th and ending with december 31th. To do this sorting we can for example perhaps sort each date into every month and then in every month we have a loop that orders them from 1-highest date. Or maybe a loop that can order in months and dates all together. To get the mean value of every month we will have to split the dates into months and then divide by how many dates. The logic behind 3.4 is to collect all the temperatures for each day of that year and split them by 365. If we have time we could check for leap year. 

The plan is to focus on one graph each but help eachother out when we need help.

Ilayda: 3.2
Josefine: "Own" graph
Hristiana: 3.4

Due to that we are now only two people we will make our own graph and 3.2.
We are looking at using librarys for the data.

This is what I've done until now:
I am trying to clean up the data by doing the case study from tutorial 3. This is how far I've gotten:


Turned out that there was already a finished verison we could use. Was almost done and spent two days on it but nice to have a finished and working version. With that I created the raw data from Lund and I'll try to post the file on the page.
